# Some notes on performing a PR on this repo

Sign up for github and then follow the steps below. 


## install git 

You will need to install git onto you computer or wherever you are going to be working. 

[install guide](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)


## Authenticate your account 

[https://docs.github.com/en/authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication)

I suggest a personal access token because that is probbaly the easiest way. 

## clone    

You will need to clone the repo, you will also need a github account to make the PR. From a command line run the following code: 

```
git clone https://github.com/jimcrozier/gt_econ2250.git
```

## The actual hard part : get creative 

Change something in the code. Add a link. Tweak the README. Add instructions for something that was difficult for you that you figured out. 


## Create a branch 


```
git branch -b first_name_something_descriptive
```
