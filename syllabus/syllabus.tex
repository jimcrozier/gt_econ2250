\section*{Course Description}

In this class we will cover an introduction into statistical computing which is a cornerstone to economic research. The course will be about one half statistical concepts [e.g. counts, summary statistics, and the basics of building statistical models], and one half practical coding skills that are necessary for estimating these concepts. I assume that the incoming student has a general knowledge of mathematical principles, most importantly familiarity with manipulating algebraic equations as well as basic probability theory and intuition. I also assume that the student has a basic understanding of python and notebooks. Although each of these subjects will be taught from the ground up, if this is the first encounter with any of these concepts then I expect a pretty steep learning curve. 




\section*{Course Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Introductory statistics proficiency (counts, summary stats, linear models, significance tests).
\item Introductory statistical coding python proficiency.
\item Short video presentation of notebooks skills.
\item Strengthen voice in expressing statistical analysis. 
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Texts}

You are not required to purchase these texts, the online versions are fine (although they are both great reference books)
\begin{itemize}
\item Cunningham, Scott. 2021. Causal Inference: The Mixtapes.  \href{https://mixtape.scunning.com/}{\tt\bf  Online version is fine.} 

\item Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman. 2009.  The Elements of Statistical Learning  \href{https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/}{\tt\bf  Online version is fine.} 


We will also use many online reference materials which will be listed in the github repo. 
\end{itemize} 


\section*{Honor Code and Plagiarism}
You are expected to follow the Georgia Institute of Technology Honor Code at all times. 
For any questions involving these or any other Academic Honor Code issues, please consult me or
http://www.honor.gatech.edu.

Notice that for homeworks, I am completely fine with students working together and using any online materials. That said in many of the homeworks you will each receive different data, and you are responsible for explaining the outcomes yourself.

All videos must be done by yourself, cover your own data (or data seed), and explain your own outputs. If your video presentation does not present your own results, or I do not feel that you can explain your code or results in a way that makes it clear that you understand how it is working you will not receive credit for that assignment. 


\section*{canvas}
Communication   about   the   course   and   other   course   materials   is   available   on   Georgia   Tech’s
Canvas system.  I will upload additional course materials and post course announcements on the
course page.  You may access Canvas at https://canvas.gatech.edu/.


\subsection*{Grading Policy}
\begin{itemize}
\item \underline{\textbf{40\%}} of your grade will be determined by your homework videos. There will be a total of 11 homework videos graded (see below) and I will drop the lowest grade and average the others. 
\item \underline{\textbf{25\%}} of your grade will be determined by the midterm grade. 
\item \underline{\textbf{35\%}} of your grade will be determined by a final exam.
\end{itemize}


Your final grades transfer to the Georgia Tech
grading system as follows:

\begin{tabular}{ |p{3cm}||p{3cm}|p{3cm}|p{3cm}|  }
  \hline
  \multicolumn{4}{|c|}{Grading Rubic} \\
  \hline
 A & 4.0 &Excellent&90\%-100\%\\
  \hline
  B   & 3.0    &Good&   80\%-89.99\%\\
  \hline
C&  2.0 & Satisfactory   &70\%-79.99\%\\
\hline
D&1.0 & Passing&  60\%-69.99\%\\
\hline
  F    &0.0 & Failure& < 60\%\\
  \hline
 \end{tabular}

 I  reserve   the   right   to   increase   all   final   grades   equally   if   the   material   is   more   difficult   than
 expected, but this is unlikely.   At the end of the semester your final grade cannot be changed
 with extra credit or makeup opportunities; this is for fairness to all students.
 \subsubsection*{Pass $/$fail policy}
 If you are taking the class pass/fail, you must achieve a C grade to earn a pass in the class.
 Please reach out to me at the beginning of the semester if you are taking the class pass/fail.


\subsubsection*{Homework Videos}
Homeworks are usually due on Sundays, but I reserve the right to change this as needed throughout the semester. Submit the video (youtube or loom link) and colab notebook link to Canvas. 

\textbf{*** Because I am dropping the lowest, I am not accepting late homework. ***}


Most weeks that we do not have an exam (see schedule) you will have to submit a *no longer than* 2 minute video of your notebook assignment for that week, along with the notebook. You are welcome to work with others on the homework assignment, but your video and your code/notebook will need to be your own. The videos will reviewed by the TA and given an 0-100\% grade, although final grades for the assignments will be determined by me and your talk to me if you have any issues. As always, respect and kindness are expected in all communications. This is homework so my intention here is that a good shot at the work, and admitting what you can't get should be a 100\%. The general idea here is to help you build your voice of your analysis. The grading rubric for the assignment are:
  \begin{itemize}
\item \underline{\textbf{50\%}} does the notebook achieve the directions, or at least make a solid stab at and explain what they couldn't get in their video.  
	\item \underline{\textbf{40\%}} does the video express the ideas of the analysis in a straightforward that explains what the author believes and how confident they are in the results. Just screen cast the notebook and explain what you did, and even what you didn't understand. 
\item \underline{\textbf{10\%}} is the video under 2 minutes. Not that faster is always better, but there are a lot of videos to grade and the point of this whole thing is learn to trust your voice, explain how much you believe it, and also state stuff that you didn't get. If you can do that in 30 seconds, all the better for all of us.   
\end{itemize}

Our repo will have suggestions on how to record, but you will not be reviewed on production quality, just the results. 

The point of these exercises is to get better at stats and coding, please do not attempt to just present someone's else work. It will show through in your presentations, and worst case you will not receive credit for the homework. 



\subsubsection*{Homework Videos}

\subsubsection*{Exams}
Midterm and final will be cumulative and cover statistical concepts and test the ability to read output of statistical code and explain the outputs in well formulated arguments that address central tendency and dispersion.



\subsection*{Freedom of expression}
As   a   faculty   member   at   Georgia   Tech,   I   respect   your   rights   to   the   freedom   of   speech   and
expression.  I am also committed to maintaining an orderly learning environment for all students

the Office of Student Integrity, who will investigate the incident and identify the appropriate
penalty for violations.
\subsection*{Student-faculty expectations agreement}
It   is   important   to   strive   for   an   atmosphere   of   mutual   respect,   acknowledgement,   and
responsibility   between   faculty   members   and   the   student   body.   See
\href{http://www.catalog.gatech.edu/rules/22/.}{\tt\bf http://www.catalog.gatech.edu/rules/22/.} 
 for an articulation of some basic expectations that you
can have of me and that I have of you. In the end, simple respect for knowledge, hard work, and
cordial   interactions   will   help   build   the   environment   we   seek.   Therefore,   I   encourage   you   to
remain committed to the ideals of Georgia Tech while in this class.
\subsection*{Athletics absences}
If you are a student athlete, you must obtain statements of approved absence from the Office of
the Registra (\href{https://registrar.gatech.edu/}{\tt\bf https://registrar.gatech.edu/}) one week in advance of your planned absence.  I will
accommodate your schedule if I have enough time, so please get in touch early.
